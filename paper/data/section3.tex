\chapter{Evaluation}

The goal was to confirm whether our game could improve the correctness of identifying phishing emails with a statistically significant result and understand common patterns found among users who fall for phishing attacks.

\section{Test Design}
Since we want to understand the improvement after the user plays the game, we present each user with pre-survey and post-survey questions. Both surveys contain the same email users have to classify as phishing, legitimate, or need more information (maybe phishing). In addition, we ask the user to provide an optional field to provide feedback on the choice they made.

We curated a list of 12 emails with eight phishing emails and four legitimate emails. We replicated emails from Netflix, a common service used by many individuals. In addition to emails from Netflix, we also had an email from a "co-worker." The context of the email was pre narrated in the survey question. Using emails from a domain different than PayPal allowed us to verify that our game works across different domains.

Emails for our evaluation were hand-picked from the most common phishing emails we found during our research (commonly listed in different articles, multiple occurrences in Google search). The emails include suspicious account warnings such as payment failure, login attempts, suspicious logins, account cancellation, et cetera, and some common too good to be true emails such as free Netflix. We present these emails to the user in a Gmail clone \footnote{\url{https://github.com/codermother/Gmail-Clone}}. Figure \ref{fig:evaluation_site} shows the Gmail clone site with some emails. Although the site looks visually similar to Gmail, it has limited functionality and only allows users to click on "Inbox."

    \caption{The Gmail clone used during evaluation with list of custom emails}

\end{figure}

To evaluate engagement, we ask the participants various 5-point Likert scale ration questions in the post survey. These questions were derived from "Smells Phishy?"\cite{smels_phishy}.


\section{Methodology}
\textbf{Participants}: We distributed the evaluation (along with the game) primarily through email. In addition, we had a group meeting where players completed the survey in person. In total, 13 people attempted the game. However, only 11 participants completed both the presurvey and post-survey. Therefore, we will not consider the data for the two people that did not complete the post-survey. There were four female and seven male participants. All the participants were between 20 and 40, with seven participants in the range 20-30 and 4 participants in the range 30-40. Most of our participants were currently university students, and except for one, all were either enrolled or had a previous background in computer science. The one participant that did not have a Computer Science background had a degree in Biology.

\textbf{Sessions} : All the participants had a single flow for the study.

    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
    \item Complete the pre-survey and obtain the passcode for the game. The pre-survey contains some general demographic questions and email classification questions.
    \item  Play the game. We provide the post-survey link after the player completes the game. Players can restart the game from the current week if they fail to complete it in a single try.
    \item Complete the post-survey. The post-survey contains the same set of email classification questions. In addition, it contains questions regarding game engagement.
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Data Collection}: In addition to the data collected through pre-survey and post-survey, we keep track of all activity of players in the game. This log helps us verify that players played the game in the order we want and can be used to improve future iterations of the game.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Pre-Survey}
The pre-survey responses provided the participant's pre-existing knowledge of phishing scams. We provide an optional text area to explain the user choice.

Table \ref{tab:pre_survey_responses} shows participant performance on classifying email as phishing or legitimate. We classify the user answer into five different categories:

\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
    \setlength{\parskip}{0pt}
    \setlength{\topsep}{0pt}
    \item \textbf{True Positive}: The user correctly classified the email as phishing.
    \item \textbf{True Negative}: The user correctly classified the email as legitimate.
    \item \textbf{False Positive}: The user incorrectly classified the phishing email as legitimate.
    \item \textbf{False Negative}: The user incorrectly classified the legitimate email as phishing.
    \item \textbf{Marked Maybe}: The user thinks it is potentially phishing and needs more information.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
        \hline
        \textbf{Answer} & \textbf{Average Score} \\
        \hline
        True Positive   & 4.45                   \\
        True Negative   & 3                      \\
        False Positive  & 2.09                   \\
        False Negative  & 0.37                   \\
        Marked Maybe    & 2.09                   \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Pre-Survey Responses and average scores of each answer}
    \label{tab:pre_survey_responses}
\end{table}

% Our pre-survey result showed that participants had some knowledge about phishing. On average, they correctly classified more than half of phishing emails. However, we can see that participants misclassified some legitimate emails as "Maybe Phishing" or marked "Phishing."

We manually reviewed the user text responses to understand why they made each decision. We noticed similar thought processes in many of the participants:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participants who missed phishing emails were more suspicious of the content of the email. For example, some participants thought organizations do not send emails regarding common account information/errors such as subscription cancellation, number update, etc. Account update emails are commonly sent to the account holder by existing popular services.
    \item Only a couple of participants actively looked at technical details such as the link and the sender. Since participants focused more on the context of the email, any email that asked or put some personal context in the email was marked as potentially phishing or phishing.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Game}
Users start the game after the pre-survey. Since we distributed the game through email, we need to verify that the user completed the survey before attempting the game. Therefore, we passcode lock the game and give the passcode at the end of the pre-survey.

Participants took a little over 25 minutes to complete the game. The fastest recorded time was 18 minutes, and the longest was 43 minutes. We noticed that participants took the longest in Week 3, where they had to play around with different domains. Table \ref{tab:game_time} shows the average time user took for each week.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{r r r r }
        \hline
        \textbf{Week} & \textbf{Average Time} & \textbf{Fastest Time} & \textbf{Slowest Time} \\
        1             & 2.27                  & 1.77                  & 2.80                  \\
        2             & 5.18                  & 4.18                  & 6.73                  \\
        3             & 10.54                 & 2.11                  & 18.18                 \\
        4             & 8.54                  & 4.00                  & 23.43                 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Average time user took for each week (in minutes)}
    \label{tab:game_time}
\end{table}

We can see that participants quickly figured out spelling and grammar errors in Week 1. Similarly, participants did not have trouble understanding different link hiding techniques. However, many participants had to redo Week 3 as they could not find good domains to try. Some participants tried domains that had no connection with PayPal, such as "starbucks.com," "fredmeyer.com," and "youtube.org." However, participants figured out that purchasing similar domains provided better efficiency. Table \ref{tab:marketplace_domains} shows different domains used in the game.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l c  }
        \hline
        \textbf{Domains}       & \textbf{Number of used} \\
        paypal.org             & 8                       \\
        paypai.com             & 8                       \\
        paypal.co              & 4                       \\
        paypal.nl              & 1                       \\

        paypal-paypal.com      & 1                       \\
        billingpal.com         & 1                       \\
        paypay-hotmail.com     & 1                       \\
        paypal.gov             & 1                       \\
        paypal.cm              & 1                       \\

        fredmeyer.com          & 1                       \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Different domains purchased in the marketplace in game}
    \label{tab:marketplace_domains}
\end{table}

Although, most participants chose domains with the alternate ending as suggested by the game (when they enter paypal.com). Some users were creative and figured our purchasing paypaI.com (with i) would make it look visually similar and be more efficient.

A few participants had a problem with spoofing, but generally, participants quickly understood spoofing and used efficient email addresses. Table \ref{tab:spoofing_emails} shows different emails used by participants during spoofing. Participants used efficient domains (paypal.com) with commonly seen names such as accounts, contact, support, etc.

\begin{table}

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Some spoofing emails used by participants}
    \label{tab:spoofing_emails}
\end{table}

\subsection{Post-Survey}
The post-survey responses give us an idea of our game's effectiveness by allowing us to compare the before and after game scores. In addition to classifying the emails, we ask the participants 5-point Likert scale questions. Table \ref{tab:post_survey_responses} shows participant performance on classifying email.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l}
        \hline
        \textbf{Answer} & \textbf{Average Score} \\
        \hline
        True Positive   & 5.73                   \\
        True Negative   & 1.45                   \\
        False Positive  & 2.54                   \\
        False Negative  & 1.09                   \\
        Marked Maybe    & 1.27                   \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Post-Survey Responses and average scores of each answer}
    \label{tab:post_survey_responses}
\end{table}

We manually reviewed user text responses on why they made certain choices (similar to what we did in the pre-survey). We noticed a few common thoughts:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Participants were paying closer attention to the sender of the emails. However, many participants did not trust emails generated from a subdomain such as mailer.netflix.com. Instead, users believed that companies generally send emails from a primary domain like "netflix.com."
    \item Most of the participants noticed the links hidden under the text. Participants actively avoided links that were phishing, such as "netflixmovies.com."
    \item Few participants were still untrusting of the content of the email, especially contents with private details such as phone number and credit card info.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Pre vs Post Phishing Knowledge}
Table \ref{tab:pre_vs_post} shows the change in the average score of the participants before and after the game. Although we can not confidently claim that our game improved performance given the sample size and change in score, a few things stand out.

\begin{table}[!ht]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l r}
        \hline
        \textbf{Answer} & \textbf{Change in averge score} \\
        \hline
        True Positive   & 1.27                   \\
        True Negative   & -0.45                   \\
        False Positive  &   -0.64                \\
        False Negative  & 0.73                 \\
        Marked Maybe    & -0.82                  \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Change in average score in pre-survey vs post-survey. Positive score indicate higher average score in the post survey.}
    \label{tab:pre_vs_post}
\end{table}

Participants were more confident in their email classification and marked their email either phishing or non-phishing. For example, one of the participants went from six "Maybe Phishing" to two. Only two out of eleven participants marked more emails as maybe phishing (+1 compared to pre-survey).

Participants were correctly identifying more phishing emails. We see, on average, participants correctly identified 1.27 more phishing emails. In addition, we also saw a decrease in false positives. Only one participant had a lower true positive score (the participants missed one email (-1 true positive)).

Our results show that participants were also more skeptical of legitimate emails. Six participants were marking at least one of the legitimate emails as phishing.

We can see that the game had positive impact on the participants. Participants were better at identifying phishing emails and all the participants had at least a partial knowledge about protective actions. Based on participants comments, we  can see they had at least some knowledge about different objectives of the game: spoofing, link hiding, and language skills.

\section{Questionaire}
Table \ref{tab:game_questions} shows different opinion-based questions asked in the post-survey. The focus of the questionnaire was to assess participants' perceptions and opinions of the game and collect additional feedback about potential improvements.  Likert-scale questions used a 5-point scale ranging from 1 = strongly disagree to 5 = strongly agree.

\begin{table}[!ht]

        1. & The game showed phishing tricks.                                                    & 4.90                    \\
        2. &I better understand phishing scams after playing the game.                          & 4.54                    \\

        5. &The game taught me how to protect myself from phishing.                             & 4.27                    \\
        6. &I learned something new.                                                             & 4.72                    \\

        \hline
        8. &I would like to play the game again.                                                & 2.9                     \\

        10. &I prefer reading an educational document to playing a game to learn about phishing. & 1.81                    \\
        11.& Education games are important to understand security.                              & 4.45                    \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Likert questions relating opinion of the game; Higher score means more positive response}
    \label{tab:game_questions}
\end{table}

Questions 1-7 (in table \ref{tab:game_questions}) focus on the educational features of the game and user feelings towards our approach. Based on the average score, we can see that participants welcomed the game and found it helpful. Figure \ref{fig:phishing_game_questions_1} summarizes the distribution of responses for each questions relating to phishing. We had positive responses for the game and techniques displayed in the game. For example, almost all participants agreed that the game showed phishing tricks and a majority of participants strongly agree that the game helped them understand phishing better.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{section3/user_reponse_1.png}
    \caption{Participants response to the first 7 questions. The numbers correspond to the question numbers in table \ref{tab:game_questions}.}
    \label{fig:phishing_game_questions_1}
\end{figure}

The second set of questions (8-11 in table \ref{tab:game_questions}) is related to participants' general opinions of the game and game-based learning. Figure \ref{fig:phishing_game_questions_2} illustrates the distribution of responses for question through 8-11.  More than half of the participants mentioned that they would not play the game again. We had a chance to talk to many of the participants and got common feedback on the gameplay. They were eager to play it the first time but would not like to play it again.

The majority of the participants did not find the game hard and could complete the game objective. However, we believe the game can be further simplified with better UI and hints to the player.

Finally, we asked participants their opinion on game-based learning. We can see that most of the participants prefer educational games over reading materials. Only one participant favored reading books over educational games for training purposes.

    \label{fig:phishing_game_questions_2}
\end{figure}


\section{Participant Feedback}
At the end of the post-survey, we allow participants to express any comments or improvements to the game. The majority of the comments were positive about the game and pointed out it was a good experience. However, the majority of participants wanted a concise version of the game. One of the participants said he would ask his family to try out the game if it was short.
